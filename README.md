# BigMart Sales Prediction

This Python script predicts sales for a retail store based on various features such as item details and outlet information. It uses a pre-trained machine learning model to make predictions.

## Dataset

- **Dataset Name**: Big Mart Sales Prediction Datasets
- **Data Source**: [data upload ob git](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivan118/big-mart-sales-prediction-datasets)

## Project Structure

- **README.md**: Documentation of the project.
- **main.py**: Python script for making sales predictions.
- **encoder.joblib**: Pre-trained categorical encoder for preprocessing input data.
- **Big Mart Sales Prediction.ipynb**:model training and data-pre-processing.
- **model.joblib**: when you run 'Big Mart Sales Prediction.ipynb' its automatically ave in directory

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd bigmart-sales-prediction
2. Create a virtual environment (recommended) and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate

## Usage
-Clone this repository to your local machine.

-Ensure you have the pre-trained model ('model.joblib') and encoder ('encoder.joblib') in the same directory as the script ('main.py').

-Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

-Run the script with the required arguments for item details and outlet information.
## For example:
    ``` python main.py --Item_Identifier "ABC123" --Item_Weight 10.5 --Item_Fat_Content "Low Fat" --Item_Visibility 0.05 --Item_Type "Grocery" --Item_MRP 120.5 --Outlet_Identifier "OUT01" --Outlet_Establishment_Year 1990 --Outlet_Size "Medium" --Outlet_Location_Type "Tier 1" --Outlet_Type "Supermarket"

Follow the instructions in the script to make sales predictions.

## Model Training
The project uses a machine learning model to predict sales based on input features. The pre-trained model is saved as 'model.joblib', and the categorical encoder is saved as 'encoder.joblib'.

## Results
The project provides predictions for sales based on the input features. The performance of the model may vary depending on the dataset used.

## Future Improvements
There are several ways to improve the model and the project:

-Explore more advanced machine learning techniques.

-Fine-tune hyperparameters for better model performance.

-Gather more labeled data for improved accuracy.
